#MentorMe

MentorMe is a scheduling app that provides a convenient way for mentors and students to connect and plan meetings. Mentors can create meetings and tag their specific skillsets, and students can signup. Students can also search for appointments by tagged skills. Once the session has been completed, both parties can review each other.
